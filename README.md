# Rest-Assured Automation Project


Welcome to my Rest-Assured Automation Project.

I created this project with the intention of practicing the knowledge acquired through courses and research.

In this project, I chose to automate tests on the public API  <a href="https://dummyjson.com/"> DummyJSON </a>.

DummyJSON is a widely used fake RestFull API for testing with automation tools.

Hope you enjoy it, feel free to reach out to me.

A link to my LinkedIn profile will be available at the bottom of the page.



# About the project


In the tests, I chose Rest-Assured framework as the core for automating the requests made to the DummyJson API.

I also used frameworks like JUnit and Hamcrest to make assertions after each request sent.

The programming language used in the project development is JAVA.



# Before starting

To run the tests, you will first need to have some tools on your machine.

* Git

Git is required to make a copy of the project on your machine.

* Java 

Java is the language that was used for project development.



* Maven

Maven is a dependency and application build manager used in JAVA. It's also responsible for initiating test execution.

If you have any questions about any of the mentioned tools, I will leave a link to the documentation for all project dependencies at the bottom of the page.
